 Question 6
BadStore uses cookies to implement session keys, once you’ve authenticated, and to track the contents of the cart, once you’ve added something to it. You can inspect these cookies in use by BadStore in various ways. One way is to do an XSS attack on the guest book. Get the guest book to run the code \color{red}{\verb|<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>|}<script>alert(document.cookie)</script> and it will tell you the current cookies. (Be sure you have popups enabled on your browser or this won’t work.) Alternatively, you can examine the cookies directly using Firefox developer tools. Recall that cookies are pairs key=value. What is the key name of the session cookie?
ans.SSOid=YWRtaW46NWViZTIyOTRlY2QwZTBmMDhlYWI3NjkwZDJhNmVlNjk6TWFzdGVyIFN5c3RlbSBBZG1p%0AbmlzdHJhdG9yOkE%3D%0A; CartID=1416121184%3A2%3A4010.5%3A1000%3A1004 SSOid
